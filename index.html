                <p>APPLICATION PROCESS AND SCREENING CRITERIA 

* We offer an application form to everyone. 

* We review only fully completed applications in the order in which we receive them. 

* We may require up to 5 business days to verify information on any application. 

* We screen the following: Financial Background, Criminal Background, Prior Rental History, References.  

Complete Application 

* Each applicant over the age of 18 must submit an individual application via our website. 

* We will not review incomplete applications. Application is complete when all the tenants and co-signers have submitted their individual applications. 

* Applicants must present a piece of government issued identification with a photograph. 

* We will accept the first qualified applicant(s). 

Financial Background 

* Household income shall be at least 2.5 times the monthly rent (non-Portland), or 2 or 2.5 times the monthly income in Portland (excluding utilities).  

* If a co-signer is necessary, the co-signer must also complete and sign an application. The acceptance of a co-signer is not a normal policy and is subject to individual approval or denial by Pacific Homes Northwest. 

* Income must be verifiable through pay stubs or employer contact; award letters for Social Security, alimony, child support, welfare, utility or housing assistance; current tax records; or bank statements. 

* We may require you to submit a copy of your credit report obtained within the past 30 days. 

* Negative credit reports may result in denial of application. Negative reports include, but are not limited to: late payments, collections, judgments, total debt load, and bankruptcy. 

Criminal Background 

* Applicants will be denied for criminal convictions or pending charges that include but are not limited to: drug-related crimes, person crimes, sex offenses, any crimes involving financial fraud (including identity theft or forgery), or any other crime that would adversely impact the health, safety or right of peaceful enjoyment of the premises of the residents, landlord or landlords agent. 

    * Effective 1/1/2020, landlords are subject to the following changes in screening guidelines: 1.  When evaluating an applicant, the landlord may not consider drug-related convictions based solely on the use or possession of marijuana. .2  When evaluating an applicant, the landlord may not consider the possession of a medical marijuana card or status as a medical marijuana patient when making a determination about the suitability of an applicant. Affordable housing providers subject to federal laws prohibiting the use or possession of marijuana (including medical marijuana) by residents on the premises may continue to enforce those rules with their residents. 

Prior Rental History 

* No evictions within the past five years. We do not consider evictions which took place five years or more ago, nor do we consider evictions which resulted in a dismissal or a general judgment for the applicant. 

* Applicants must provide the information necessary to contact past landlords. 

References 

* Favorable references from current employers, past landlords and other relevant persons. 

Explanations/Exceptions 

* All applicants may submit a written explanation with their application if there are extenuating circumstances which require additional consideration. 

* If, after making a good faith effort, we are unable to verify information on your application, or if you fail to pass any of the screening criteria, the application process will be terminated. 

* Exceptions may be made for applicants with increased deposits or qualified co-signers at the sole discretion of the Owner/Agent. 

* Applicants may be rejected based on the demeanor in which they treat the Owner/Agent or other parties present. 

* Falsification or misrepresentation of any part of the application will result in denial
